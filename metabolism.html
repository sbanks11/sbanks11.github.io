            <div class="callout">
                <p>Did you know that after age 40, your body can become "metabolically rigid"â€”meaning it gets stuck burning sugar for energy instead of fat?</p>
            </div>

            <p>This isn't about a slow metabolism.</p>
            <p>It's not about eating too much or exercising too little.</p>
            <p>And it's definitely not about lacking willpower.</p>
            <p><strong>It's about your body being locked into the wrong fuel source.</strong></p>

            <p>Think about it like this: Your body is like a hybrid car that can run on two types of fuelâ€”sugar or fat.</p>

            <p>When you're younger, your body switches between these fuel sources effortlessly. Carbs for quick energy. Fat stores when you need sustained fuel.</p>

            <p>But after 40â€”especially during perimenopause and menopauseâ€”something shifts.</p>

            <p><strong>Your body gets "stuck" in sugar-burning mode.</strong></p>

            <h2>And when you're constantly burning sugar for fuel, three things happen:</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>You experience afternoon energy crashes (because sugar burns fast and leaves you empty)</li>
                <li>Evening cravings become overwhelming (your body is desperately searching for more quick fuel)</li>
                <li>Stubborn belly fat refuses to budge (because your body never gets the signal to tap into fat stores)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This is what I call "Metabolic Rigidity."</p>

            <p>And if you're a woman over 40 who's been doing "everything right"â€”eating healthy, staying active, drinking your waterâ€”yet still struggling with that frustrating midsection weight and zero energy by 3pm...</p>

            <p><strong>This is very likely what's happening inside your body right now.</strong></p>

            <h2>The Moment I Realized My Metabolism Wasn't Brokenâ€”Just Rigidly Stuck</h2>

            <p>My name is Sarah, and I'm 52 years old.</p>

            <p>For years, I thought my metabolism was just... done. Broken. Dead. Never coming back.</p>

            <p>I'd wake up exhausted, drag myself through the day, and by 8pm I'd be standing in front of the pantry, hand reaching for crackers or cookiesâ€”even though I'd promised myself that morning I'd "be good."</p>

            <p>I'd try everything: cutting calories, eating more salads, going for walks, even those intense HIIT workouts my daughter swore by.</p>

            <p>And maybe I'd lose 3 or 4 pounds.</p>
            <p>Then gain back 6.</p>

            <p>The scale became my enemy. My jeans stopped fitting. I started avoiding photos.</p>

            <p>And the worst part? I felt invisible.</p>

            <p>My husband wasn't cruel about itâ€”he never said anything meanâ€”but I could feel the distance. The spark we used to have felt... dimmed.</p>

            <p>I'd look in the mirror and see someone I didn't recognize anymore. Someone tired. Heavy. Older than her years.</p>

            <p>I felt like a stranger trapped in someone else's body.</p>

            <p><em>Maybe you know that feeling too.</em></p>

            <h2>But here's what I didn't understand back thenâ€”and what changed everything once I finally learned it:</h2>

            <p><strong>My metabolism wasn't broken.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>It was just stuck.</strong></p>

            <p>And the reason nothing workedâ€”not the diets, not the workouts, not even cutting out my favorite foodsâ€”was because I was fighting the wrong battle.</p>

            <p>I was trying to force my body to burn fat...</p>
            <p>...while it was still locked into sugar-burning mode.</p>

            <p>It's like trying to switch your car to electric mode when it's stuck in gas-only gear.</p>
            <p>No matter how hard you press the pedal, it won't shift.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h2>The Mentor Who Finally Explained What Was Really Going On</h2>

            <p>Everything changed when I met Dr. Patricia Holloway, a menopause and metabolism specialist, at a friend's wellness event.</p>

            <p>I almost didn't go. I was tired, bloated, and honestly didn't want to be around all those "fit, happy women" who seemed to have it all figured out.</p>

            <p>But my friend dragged me.</p>
            <p>And I'm so grateful she did.</p>

            <p>Dr. Holloway was giving a talk on metabolic health after 40, and something she said stopped me cold:</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>"If you're over 40 and your belly fat won't budge no matter what you do, your metabolism isn't brokenâ€”it's metabolically rigid. And the harder you diet and push yourself, the MORE rigid it becomes."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I felt like she was speaking directly to me.</p>

            <p>After her talk, I approached her, almost in tears. I told her everything: the weight gain, the exhaustion, the cravings, the frustration of "doing everything right" and still failing.</p>

            <p>She smiledâ€”not in a pitying way, but in an understanding wayâ€”and said something I'll never forget:</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>"Sarah, your body isn't against you. It's just stuck using the wrong fuel. And once we help it remember how to burn fat again, everything changes."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h2>What Is "Metabolic Rigidity" And Why Does It Happen After 40?</h2>

            <p>Dr. Holloway explained it to me like this:</p>

            <p>When you're younger, your body is metabolically flexible. It switches easily between burning carbs (sugar) and burning fat depending on what you eat and what you need.</p>

            <p>But as we ageâ€”especially women during perimenopause and menopauseâ€”our hormones shift.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Insulin sensitivity decreases.</li>
                <li>Cortisol (the stress hormone) stays elevated longer.</li>
                <li>And your body starts favoring sugar as its primary fuel source... because it's easier and faster.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The problem?</p>

            <p>Sugar burns fast. It gives you a quick spike, then crashes you hard.</p>

            <p>And when your body is stuck in sugar-burning mode, it never gets the signal to tap into your fat stores.</p>

            <p>So that stubborn belly fat? Those love handles? That softness around your hips? Your body is literally ignoring them as a fuel source.</p>

            <p><strong>And no amount of calorie cutting or cardio is going to change thatâ€”because you're not addressing the real problem. You're trying to lose fat while your body is stuck burning sugar.</strong></p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h2>"So How Do I Get My Body Unstuck?"</h2>

            <p>That's exactly what I asked Dr. Holloway.</p>
            <p>And her answer surprised me.</p>

            <p>She said, "You need to give your body a gentle signalâ€”a metabolic nudgeâ€”that helps it remember how to access fat for fuel again."</p>

            <p>She explained that one of the most effective ways to do this is through something called <strong>exogenous ketones</strong>.</p>

            <p>Now, if you've heard of the keto diet and immediately thought, "Oh no, not another restrictive diet," I get it. That was my first thought too.</p>

            <p><strong>But here's the thing: You don't have to do a full keto diet to get the benefits of ketones.</strong></p>

            <p>Ketones are natural molecules your body produces when it burns fat for fuel. They're like a "premium fuel" for your brain and musclesâ€”clean, steady, no crashes.</p>

            <p>But when your metabolism is rigid and stuck in sugar-burning mode, your body isn't making enough ketones on its own.</p>

            <p>That's where exogenous ketones come in.</p>

            <p>Exogenous just means "from outside your body."</p>

            <p>So instead of forcing yourself into a strict, no-carb diet to produce ketones naturally (which is hard, unsustainable, and honestly miserable), you can take a supplement that provides your body with ketones directly.</p>

            <p>And when you do thatâ€”when you give your body that gentle metabolic signal every morningâ€”something shifts.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p>Your body starts to remember: "Oh. I can burn fat for fuel. I don't have to rely on sugar all day."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h2>The 10-Second Morning Ritual That Changed Everything</h2>

            <p>Dr. Holloway recommended I try a specific type of exogenous ketone supplementâ€”one that combined three forms of BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) mineral salts: magnesium, calcium, and sodium.</p>

            <p>She called it "The Fat-to-Fuel Switch."</p>

            <p>Every morning, I'd take one capsule with a glass of water.</p>
            <p>That's it.</p>
            <p>10 seconds.</p>

            <p>No meal prep. No calorie counting. No giving up my morning coffee.</p>

            <p>Just one simple capsule to help signal my body: "Hey, let's start burning fat today."</p>

            <p>Now, I'm not going to lie and tell you I lost 20 pounds in a week. That didn't happen.</p>

            <p>But here's what DID happenâ€”and it happened fast:</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3 class="timeline-heading">Day 3:</h3>
                <p>I noticed I wasn't as ravenously hungry by mid-morning. Usually, I'd be eyeing the break room donuts by 10am. But I just... didn't feel the pull.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3 class="timeline-heading">Day 7:</h3>
                <p>My energy felt different. Not jittery like coffee or diet pillsâ€”just steady. I made it through my afternoon without that brutal 3pm crash where I'd normally want to curl up under my desk.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3 class="timeline-heading">Day 10:</h3>
                <p>The evening cravingsâ€”the ones that had sabotaged me for YEARSâ€”were... quieter. I'd finish dinner and actually feel satisfied. No more prowling the kitchen at 9pm looking for something sweet or salty.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3 class="timeline-heading">Week 3:</h3>
                <p>My jeans felt looser. Not dramatically, but noticeably. I wasn't weighing myself obsessively anymore, but I could feel itâ€”my belly felt less bloated, less puffy. My husband noticed too. He said, "You seem lighter. Like, happier."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3 class="timeline-heading">Week 6:</h3>
                <p>I stepped on the scale. Down 11 pounds.</p>
                <p>But honestly? The number wasn't even the best part.</p>
                <p>The best part was feeling like myself again. I had energy to play with my grandkids. I didn't dread getting dressed in the morning. I stopped avoiding mirrors and photos. I felt... in control again.</p>

            <h2>"But Sarah, What Exactly Was In That Capsule?"</h2>

            <p>Great question.</p>

            <p>The supplement Dr. Holloway recommendedâ€”and the one I still use every single morningâ€”is called <strong>BurnPeak</strong>.</p>

            <p>It's not a diet pill. It's not a stimulant (no caffeine, no jitters, no racing heart).</p>

            <p>It's a pure BHB ketone formula specifically designed to help women over 40 flip their Fat-to-Fuel Switch.</p>

            <div class="product-image-container">
                <img src="./src/assets/burnpeak-product.png" alt="BurnPeak supplement bottles - BHB ketone formula for women over 40" class="product-image">
            </div>

            <p><strong>Here's what's inside each capsule:</strong></p>

            <div class="ingredient-card">
                <h3 class="ingredient-title">1. Magnesium Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB)</h3>
                <p>Provides your body with exogenous ketones to help signal fat-burning mode. Magnesium also supports muscle function and helps reduce bloating.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ingredient-card">
                <h3 class="ingredient-title">2. Calcium Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB)</h3>
                <p>Another ketone source that works synergistically with magnesium to help your body access stored fat more efficientlyâ€”especially around the belly, hips, and thighs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ingredient-card">
                <h3 class="ingredient-title">3. Sodium Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB)</h3>
                <p>Supports steady energy and mental clarity throughout the day. Sodium is also an important electrolyte that helps prevent fatigue and brain fog.</p>
            </div>

            <p>That's it.</p>

            <p>No herbal fillers. No harsh stimulants. No mystery ingredients you can't pronounce. Just three clean, researched forms of BHB to help your body remember how to burn fat again.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h2>Why BHB Works So Well For Women Over 40 (Especially If You've Tried Everything Else)</h2>

            <p>Here's the thing most weight loss supplements get wrong:</p>

            <p>They try to force your body to do something it's not ready to do.</p>

            <p>They pump you full of caffeine to "speed up your metabolism" (which just makes you jittery and crashes you later).</p>

            <p>Or they use appetite suppressants that make you feel sick and miserable.</p>

            <p><strong>BurnPeak works differently.</strong></p>

            <p>Instead of forcing or fighting your body, it works WITH your body's natural biology.</p>

            <p>When you take BHB ketones in the morning, you're giving your body a gentle signal: "Here's some premium fuel. You can use fat for energy. You don't need to rely on sugar all day."</p>

            <p>And over timeâ€”sometimes as quickly as 7-10 daysâ€”your body starts to respond.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It remembers how to access fat stores.</li>
                <li>Your energy stabilizes.</li>
                <li>Your cravings quiet down.</li>
                <li>And that stubborn belly fat? It finally starts to shrink.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Not because you're starving yourself.</p>
            <p>Not because you're punishing yourself with brutal workouts.</p>
            <p><strong>But because your metabolism is finally UNSTUCK.</strong></p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h2>"Okay Sarah, But Does This Really Work For Women Like Me?"</h2>

            <p>I had the exact same question.</p>

            <p>So let me share a few stories from women who felt just as skeptical as you might feel right now...</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p class="testimonial-header"><strong>Linda, 58, Ohio</strong></p>
                <p>"I've been post-menopausal for 6 years, and I thought my weight was just... permanent. I tried BurnPeak because my sister wouldn't stop raving about it. Within 2 weeks, I noticed my evening snacking just stopped. I wasn't white-knuckling itâ€”I just didn't want it anymore. I'm down 14 pounds in 5 weeks and I feel like I'm finally getting my body back."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p class="testimonial-header"><strong>Jennifer, 46, Texas</strong></p>
                <p>"I'm a nurse, so I'm on my feet all day. But by the time I got home, I was SO exhausted I'd just collapse and eat whatever was easyâ€”usually junk. BurnPeak gave me steady energy that lasted through my shift. No crash. No jitters. And the weight around my midsection is finally coming off. My scrubs fit again!"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p class="testimonial-header"><strong>Michelle, 61, California</strong></p>
                <p>"I was skeptical because I've wasted so much money on supplements that did nothing. But BurnPeak is different. It's not dramatic or flashyâ€”it just works quietly. My cravings are manageable, my energy is better, and I've lost 9 pounds without changing much else. I'm a believer now."</p>
            </div>

            <p>These women aren't fitness influencers. They're not getting paid to say this.</p>

            <p>They're just real women who were stuck... and finally got unstuck. Just like I did.</p>

            <h2>"But Sarah, I've Tried Keto Before And It Was Miserable. Do I Have To Do That Again?"</h2>

            <p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>

            <p>And I'm so glad you asked, because this is one of the biggest misconceptions about BurnPeak.</p>

            <p><strong>You do NOT have to follow a strict keto diet to see results.</strong></p>

            <p>Let me explain why.</p>

            <p>When people think "keto," they think of cutting out all carbs, eating bacon and butter for every meal, and suffering through the dreaded "keto flu" for weeks.</p>

            <p>And yesâ€”if you're trying to force your body into ketosis through diet alone, it's hard. Really hard.</p>

            <p><strong>But here's the beauty of exogenous ketones like the ones in BurnPeak:</strong></p>

            <p>They give your body ketones WITHOUT requiring you to eliminate carbs entirely.</p>

            <p>So you can still eat real food. You can still enjoy your morning toast or a sensible pasta dinner.</p>

            <p>You're not depriving yourself or living on lettuce and chicken breast.</p>

            <p>BurnPeak simply helps your body become more metabolically flexible againâ€”so it can burn both carbs AND fat efficiently, instead of being stuck in one mode.</p>

            <p>Think of it like this:</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p>A strict keto diet is like forcing your car to only run on electric powerâ€”no gas allowed, ever.</p>
                <p>BurnPeak is like helping your hybrid car remember it CAN switch to electric modeâ€”while still being able to use gas when it needs to.</p>
            </div>

            <p>You get the benefits of fat-burning without the misery of restriction.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h2>"What If I'm Sensitive To Supplements? Will This Make Me Feel Weird?"</h2>

            <p>This was one of MY biggest concerns.</p>

            <p>I've tried fat burners before that made my heart race. I felt jittery, anxious, couldn't sleep. It was awful.</p>

            <p><strong>BurnPeak contains ZERO stimulants.</strong></p>

            <p>No caffeine. No green tea extract. No sketchy herbal blends. Just pure BHB mineral salts.</p>

            <p>For most women, the transition is smooth. You might notice:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Slightly less appetite (but not in a sick, nauseous wayâ€”just a natural "I'm satisfied" feeling)</li>
                <li>Steadier energy (no jitters, no crash)</li>
                <li>Better focus (BHB is incredible brain fuel)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some women do experience mild digestive adjustment in the first few daysâ€”maybe a little bloating or loose stoolsâ€”but it's usually temporary as your body adapts.</p>

            <p>And if you're ever concerned, you can start with just half a capsule for the first few days to let your body ease in.</p>

            <p>Dr. Holloway always said: "Listen to your body. This should feel supportive, not stressful."</p>

            <h2>"How Long Does It Actually Take To See Results?"</h2>

            <p>Here's the honest truth, based on my experience and the hundreds of women I've now talked to who've tried BurnPeak:</p>

            <p><strong style="font-size: 1.125rem;">Early wins happen fast. Real transformation takes consistency.</strong></p>

            <p>Here's what you can realistically expect:</p>

            <div class="timeline-item" style="border-left: 4px solid hsl(var(--primary));">
                <h3 class="timeline-heading" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Week 1: The "Something's Different" Phase</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Most women notice within 7-10 days that:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <li>Evening cravings are quieter</li>
                    <li>Energy feels steadier (no 3pm crash)</li>
                    <li>Bloating and puffiness decrease</li>
                    <li>They feel more motivated and clear-headed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item" style="border-left: 4px solid hsl(var(--primary));">
                <h3 class="timeline-heading" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Weeks 2-4: The "It's Actually Working" Phase</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">This is when results become visible:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <li>5-10 pounds lost</li>
                    <li>Jeans fit better (especially around the waist)</li>
                    <li>Energy is consistently high throughout the day</li>
                    <li>Cravings are manageableâ€”you're in control</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item" style="border-left: 4px solid hsl(var(--primary));">
                <h3 class="timeline-heading" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Weeks 6-12: The "I Feel Like Myself Again" Phase</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">This is where the real transformation happens:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    <li>15-25+ pounds lost (depending on your starting point)</li>
                    <li>Sustained energy all day, every day</li>
                    <li>Cravings are manageableâ€”you're in control, not food</li>
                    <li>Confidence is back. You feel proud when you look in the mirror.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>And here's the best part:</strong></p>

            <p>Because you're not starving or depriving yourself, the results actually stick.</p>

            <p>You're not white-knuckling your way through some miserable diet you'll quit in 3 weeks. You're retraining your metabolism to work the way it's supposed to.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h2>"Okay, I'm Interested. But How Do I Know This Isn't Just Another Scam?"</h2>

            <p>I'm so glad you're asking this question.</p>

            <p>Because if you're a woman over 40 who's tried supplement after supplement that promised the world and delivered nothing... You have every right to be skeptical.</p>

            <p>I was too.</p>

            <p>So let me be completely transparent with you about BurnPeakâ€”the good, the bad, and the honest truth.</p>
